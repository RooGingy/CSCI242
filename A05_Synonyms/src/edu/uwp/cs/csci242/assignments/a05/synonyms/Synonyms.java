/**
 * Synonyms Analyzer for Classic Literature Texts
 * <p>
 * This class provides functionality to analyze and determine synonym relationships between words across
 * various classic literary works. It utilizes a nested HashMap data structure to store and quantify
 * these relationships based on the occurrence of words in similar contexts within the provided texts.
 * <p>
 * The primary operations include parsing texts to build the synonym data structure, calculating dot products
 * and magnitudes for vectors represented by word counts, and determining cosine similarity between words
 * to evaluate their similarity. The application is interactive, prompting the user for input to analyze
 * relationships dynamically, which illustrates the practical application of data structures and algorithms
 * in a real-world text analysis context.
 * <p>
 * Usage involves initializing the class with URLs to the texts, which are then parsed to build the synonym
 * descriptors. Users can then query the relationships interactively via the command line interface.

     * from reading the URLs, hence the necessity of declaring this exception in the constructor's signature.

     * @throws IOException If an error occurs during URL access or data reading, this exception is thrown to indicate
     *                     such problems, ensuring that the calling code can handle these errors appropriately.
